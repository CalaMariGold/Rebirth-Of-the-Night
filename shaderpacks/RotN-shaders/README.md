# RotN-shaders

This directory contains shaders used for RotN, which currently fixes vanilla fog and adds a shader for a specific block.

Performance impact should be negligible, but if you do notice a performance decrease, feel free to disable the shaderpack. The shaderpack is not required for normal gameplay.

Credit goes to Builderb0y for creating a base shaderpack containing all shader files, which made it convenient to edit.
